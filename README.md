## Tech Stack🛠️

- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express.js to serve web requests.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing user data and secrets.
- **Authentication**: Passport.js for local username/password authentication and Google OAuth2 authentication.
- **Security**: Uses bcrypt for password hashing to ensure user data security.
